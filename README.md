# SAT Scores in NYC Schools

### This project explores SAT data and considers how various factors affect student performance

We find that predominately black schools are almost universally located in the central Bronx. Students in these schools
report the lowest sense of safety and on average underpeform on the SAT.

We also find that schools with predominately immigrant populations are primarily in north Manhattan and Queens, and
those schools specifically geared towards new immigrants have abysmal SAT scores, demonstrating the language bias in
the test.

The highest performing schools tend to be selective enrollment institutions, unsurprisingly. We also note that we can split
high performing schools between STEM focused institutions and liberal arts institutions. All of the STEM schools are majority
male, and all the liberal arts schools are majority female. There is not a strong racial trend in these categories.

This project used Basemap, matplotlib, pandas and numpy. It takes data from 7 sources available through the [NYC Open Data Platform](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).
